# VR Based Brain-Computer Interface task for Motor-Imagery Training: #
The VR task includes the representation of two virtual arms in a multimodal 3D environment and it was designed for a bi-manual task (see Figure). In addition, an adaptation of Graz visualization is pressent, displaying the traditional arrows-and-bars feedback that are used in current MI training.
