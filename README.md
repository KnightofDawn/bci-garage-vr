# VR Based Brain-Computer Interface task for Motor-Imagery Training: #
The VR task includes the representation of two virtual arms in a multimodal 3D environment and it was designed for operating two handles in order to open a garage door (see Figure). The “traditional” task involved the traditional arrows-and-bars that are used in current MI training.
